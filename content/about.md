I am a science writer, editor and programmer in Cambridge, MA. Currently: Head of Media at [New Science](https://newscience.org/). 

I'm always looking for essay ideas that would benefit young scientists, or expose them to new ways of thinking.

I write [Codon](https://www.codonmag.com/), a newsletter about synthetic biology, CRISPR and biotechnology. My work has appeared in Retraction Watch, Scientific American, Forbes, The Counter and elsewhere. Prior to journalism, I was a scientist for 7 years. I've developed CRISPR tools and have studied the link between diabetes and heart failure. I worked at the Simons Foundation for one year, where I was the data journalist at _Spectrum_.
